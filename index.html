          How can identity be expressed? (ie traditions, languages,
          spirituality, beliefs, etc) How can parts of our identity be visible
          and other parts hidden?
        </b>
        <p>
            Our identity is and isn't visible from the outside world. Our identity
          is a mixture of reference points we use to image ourselves. I identify
          myself as Pakistani, Muslim, etc. People can see me as brown, male,
          etc. I think people tend to use these reference points to draw a
          picture about themselves that they would call their "identity". But
          it's just a drawing; their identity is something completely different.
          Our real identity is something far more complex and changing forever.
          As I stated before, our identity is and isn’t visible. People can see
          me as brown and male. But they can't see who I am on the inside; they
          can't see my love for cats, my intelligence, my kindness, and my
          culture and traditions. Our invisible identity refers to the
          characteristics that cannot be readily seen such as disability,
          religion, and cultural background. Our invisible identity encapsulates
          our backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics that make us truly
          unique individuals. When we experience different places, our
          identities change—often in response to the variety of people we meet.
          Whether at home or away, globalization causes us to meet people whose
          identities may be rooted in distant places. Our engagement with people
          from afar will influence how we build and reshape our own identities.

            <p>
                Media can affect our identity in many ways; one of the ways is by
              creating stereotypes. People now think that things like interests,
              communities, and beliefs are irrelevant or pointless just because
              they don't see these things in a feed curated specifically for
              them. Something weird is that we've never been more connected than
              this and alone at the same time. All conversation topics are about
              what people saw on their feeds that day, and that just makes it
              harder to get to know someone better. People instill their
              identities with the echo chamber of content they're fed every day.
              It's nothing new, but it is extremely alarming. Compared to people
              who watch too many movies/TV shows or read too many books. But at
              least there are more interesting things to talk about there.

                The media has a powerful say on how people view and treat
              different groups based on gender and ethnicity, as news stories
              shape people's stereotypes, beliefs, and ultimately behaviors in
              areas such as education, family, and politics. It is, therefore,
              essential to understand how the media, and in particular news
              outlets, depict different groups and whether stereotypes drive
              these depictions. The media can have an impact on self-image; this
              is because individuals from underrepresented groups. Media
              representation can influence their self-esteem and self-identity.
              Seeing characters who share their cultural background succeed and
              thrive can provide a sense of validation and belonging. In 2016,
              researchers found that prolonged television exposure shows a
              decrease in self-esteem for all girls and for black boys, but an
              increase in self-esteem for white boys. These differences
              correlate with the racial and gender practices in Hollywood, which
              predominantly casts white men as heroes, while erasing or
              subordinating other groups as villains, sidekicks, and sexual
              objects. The media can also create a perception of otherness that
              portrays certain cultures or ethnicities as exotic or "other" can
              contribute to a sense of separation and difference, perpetuating
              an "us vs. them" mentality.

          globalized world?

        <p>
            In a globalized and increasingly interconnected world, it can be
          challenging for individuals to maintain their unique identities.
          However, there are several strategies that individuals can use to
          preserve and celebrate their unique identity. People can maintain
          their individual identity by focusing on cultural traditions and
          values, seeking out community, and exploring and celebrating
          differences. Keeping in touch with cultural traditions and values can
          help individuals feel connected to their heritage and can help
          maintain one’s sense of individuality. They could also join groups or
          communities that share similar cultural traditions or values and can
          provide support and a sense of belonging. Embracing and celebrating
          differences, whether cultural, ethnic, or individual, can help
          individuals maintain their unique identities and foster a sense of
          individuality.

            Additionally, we can maintain our individual identities by not
          letting those we surround ourselves with have a major influence on who
          we are. It is omnipresent that the people we surround ourselves with
          will influence who we are; however, we need to have confidence within
          ourselves to stay authentic to our true selves. We can also see this
          by the resistance of the Lubicon Cree after the Alberta Government
          stopped taking in their opinion and took their indigenous rights away; the Lubicon Cree didn't
          give in to social pressures and remained true to their identity,
          standing up for themselves.
