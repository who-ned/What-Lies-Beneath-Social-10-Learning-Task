                    How can identity be expressed? (ie traditions, languages, spirituality,
                    beliefs, etc) How can parts of our identity be visible and other parts
                    hidden?

                <p> 
                    Our identity is and isn't visible from the outside world.
                    Our identity is a mixture of reference points we use to image ourselves.
                    I identify myself as Pakistani, Muslim, etc, people can see me as brown, male etc.
                    I think people tend to use these reference points to draw a picture about themselves that they would call their "identity".
                    But it's just a drawing, their identity is something completely different.
                    Our real identity is something that cant be seen, this invisible identity is the person who we really are.
                    As I stated before, our identity is and isn't visible. People can see me as brown and male.
                    But they can't see who I Amon the inside, they can't see my love for cats, my intelligence, my kindness, and my culture and traditions.
                    Our invisible identity refers to the characteristics that cannot be readily seen such as disability, religion and cultural background.
                    Our invisible identity encapsulates our backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics that make us truly unique individuals.
                    The funny thing is that our identity is different in all the moments of our lives our lives.
                    Our identity often remains in flux and keeps changing as we live.

                <p>
                Media can affect our identity in many ways, one of the ways is by creating stereotypes.
                People now think that things like interests, communities, and beliefs are irrelevant, or pointless just because they don't see these things in a feed curated specifically for them.
                Something weird is that we've never been more connected than this and alone at the same time.
                All conversation topics are about what people saw on their feeds that day and that just makes it harder to get to know someone better.
                People instill their identities with the echo chamber of content they're fed every day.
                It's nothing new, but it is extremely alarming.
                Compared to people who watch too many movies/TV shows or read too many books.
                But at least there are more interesting things to talk about there.

                <b>How can media and/or globalization help promote the identity
                "beneath?"</b>
                <p>
                The media has a powerful say on how people view and treat different groups based on gender and ethnicity, as news stories shape people's stereotypes, beliefs, and ultimately behaviors in areas such as education, family, and politics.
                It is, therefore, essential to understand how the media, and in particular news outlets, depict different groups and whether stereotypes drive these depictions.
                The media can have an impact on self image this is because individuals from underrepresented groups, media representation can influence their self-esteem and self-identity.
                Seeing characters who share their cultural background succeed and thrive can provide a sense of validation and belonging.
                In 2016 researchers found that prolonged television exposure shows a decrease in self-esteem for all girls and for black boys, but an increase in self-esteem for white boys.
                These differences correlate with the racial and gender practices in Hollywood, which predominantly casts white men as heroes, while erasing or subordinating other groups as villains, sidekicks, and sexual objects.
                The media can also create a perception of otherness, that portrays certain cultures or ethnicities as exotic or "other" can contribute to a sense of separation and difference, perpetuating an "us vs. them" mentality.
